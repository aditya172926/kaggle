These are my code about data analysis, visualization and machine learning posted on Kaggle. 
NOTE: There are many interactive graphs and plots in these notebooks which are not shown by GitHub.
I highly recommend to visit my Kaggle profile and check out the notebooks with all the graphs and outputs there.
